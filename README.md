# ArtBadge

We have created an app called Art Badge. The app allows users to upload reviews of pieces of art and share them with other users of the app. We are building ArtBadge as our final project for [Founders&Coders FAC26](https://github.com/fac26).

## Project Scope

### What are you not building?

We are not building a React Native app, an online database of art works, a general social network app and we're not building a site for galleries to advetise new exhibitions.  

### How did you decide what features were important?

We conducted user research and usability testing. Our users gave us valuable feedback which helped us refine our initial concept. In some instances that meant intergrating new feature which we hadn't considered before and in other instances removing features that we had initialy thought essential.
