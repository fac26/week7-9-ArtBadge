# ArtBadge

We have created an app called Art Badge. The app allows users to upload reviews of pieces of art and share them with other users of the app. We are building ArtBadge as our final project for [Founders & Coders FAC26](https://github.com/fac26).

## Introduction

#### What are you building?
#### Why are you building it?

## Project Scope

<details>

### What are you not building?

We are not building a React Native app, an online database of art works, a general social network app and we're not building a site for galleries to advetise new exhibitions.  

#### How did you decide what features were important?

We conducted user research and usability testing. Our users gave us valuable feedback which helped us refine our initial concept. In some instances that meant intergrating new feature which we hadn't considered before and in other instances removing features that we had initialy thought essential.

## Software Development Lifecycle stages 

### Planning 

<details>

#### What roles did your team take on?
```
Explain the roles and responsibilities of all people working within the software development lifecycle, and how they relate to the project (K2)
```

#### Did these roles help your team work effectively?
```
Outline how teams work effectively to produce software and how to contribute appropriately (K6) Compare and contrast the requirements of a software development team, and how they would ensure that each member (including themselves) were able to make a contribution (K6)
```
</details>

### Analysis 

<details>

####  What might be the intended and unintended consequences of building this product?

</details>

### Design 

<details>

#### How did you plan a user experience?
#### What technical decisions did you make?
#### Server-render vs client-render vs both
#### Relational or non-relational or no DB
#### Self-hosted or platform-as-a-service
#### Frontend first vs DB first
#### Did you create a technical specification?
```
Review methods of software design with reference to functional/technical specifications and apply a justified approach to software development (K11, S11, S12)
```
</details>

### Implementation/Build 

<details>

#### How did you ensure your code was good?
```
Create logical and maintainable code to deliver project outcomes, explaining their choice of approach. (S1)
```

#### What interesting technical problems did you have to solve?
```
Outline and apply the rationale and use of algorithms, logic and data structures. (K9, S16)
```

#### How did you debug issues that arose?
```
Apply structured techniques to problem solving to identify and resolve issues and debug basic flaws in code (S7)
```
</details>

### Test 

<details>

#### How did you verify your project worked correctly?

```
Identify and create test scenarios which satisfy the project specification (S6)
```

#### Did writing automated tests catch any bugs?
```
Analyse unit testing results and review the outcomes, correcting errors. (S4)
```
</details>

### Deploy 

<details>

#### Where/how did you deploy your application?
```
Review and justify their contribution to building, managing and deploying code into the relevant environment in accordance with the project specification (S10)
```

#### What problems did you encounter during deployment?

</details>

### Maintain 

<details>

#### Is it easy for someone make changes to the codebase?
#### Could a new person quickly be onboarded to contribute?
```
Establishes a logical thinking approach to areas of work which require valid reasoning and/or justified decision making (B2)

Describes how they have maintained a productive, professional and secure working environment throughout the project activity (B3)
```
